# Rhino Linux 2025.2 - Plenty of fixes.

It hasn't even been a full month since our last snapshot disk image release, and yet we are happy to now tag the release of Rhino Linux 2025.2. A lot of development has gone on over the past month, with the Rhino Linux team working to solve many long-standing open issues in the [Rhino Linux Bug Tracker](https://github.com/rhino-linux/tracker). 

- **Just a small message** Smaller open source projects often operate solely on volunteer work, this includes Rhino Linux. If you would like to contribute to the development of Rhino Linux, please join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/reSvc8Ztk3) and contribute to the discussion. You can also report open issues to the [Rhino Linux Bug Tracker](https://github.com/rhino-linux/tracker)
