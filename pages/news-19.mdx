# Rhino Linux 2025.2 - Plenty of patches

It's been just about a month since our last snapshot, and we are happy to bring the release of Rhino Linux 2025.2. A lot of development has progressed, with the team working to resolve multiple longer standing issues in our [Bug Tracker](https://github.com/rhino-linux/tracker). Our release notes are shorter this time around, but pack a solid amount of fixes that we hope improve the overall usage and stability of Rhino Linux.

- **A brief message:** Last month's release kicked off the year with a bit of a bumpy start. Several major bugs slipped through our final testing stage, and we worked quickly and diligently to resolve the issues users were facing, but we strive to provide a better and fuller experience for our users, and the last release may not have met those expectations. Smaller open source projects often operate solely on volunteer work, and Rhino Linux is no exception. If you would like to contribute to the development of Rhino Linux, please join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/reSvc8Ztk3) and contribute to the discussion. You can also report new and view existing issues on the [Rhino Linux Bug Tracker](https://github.com/rhino-linux/tracker).
