# Rhino Linux 2025.2 - Plenty of fixes

It hasn't even been a full month since our last snapshot disk image release, and yet we are happy to now tag the release of Rhino Linux 2025.2. A lot of development has gone on over the past month, with the Rhino Linux team working to solve many long-standing open issues in the [Rhino Linux Bug Tracker](https://github.com/rhino-linux/tracker). 

- **Just a small message** Smaller open source projects often operate solely on volunteer work, this includes Rhino Linux. If you would like to contribute to the development of Rhino Linux, please join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/reSvc8Ztk3) and contribute to the discussion. You can also report open issues to the [Rhino Linux Bug Tracker](https://github.com/rhino-linux/tracker)

## Fixes to the Unicorn Desktop

There was a large focus on the Unicorn Desktop for this release, with us marking 4 open issues as complete relating to problems within the Unicorn Desktop.

There has been a long-standing issue with Plank, our dock component, which would cause the dock to not save user preferences once a user has logged out. We are happy to say that this issue has now officially been resolved. Additionally, another large issue that we solved within the Unicorn Desktop, caused by our Global Menu not taking up the full width of the panel, or over-extending causing panel bleed, has now finally been fixed. Finally, we have solved an issue in 2025.1 where our default wallpaper would sometimes be overwritten by XFCE.

## Further notable fixes

An issue, which was caused due to a conflict with `bluez-firmware` rendered our 2025.1 images for the Raspberry Pi to not be bootable.

We [announced](/news-18) the release of the `rhino-hotfix` utility alongside the hotfix for the PipeWire audio library, we have applied this hotfix to our disk image builder to ensure that audio will work "out of the box" again.

We solved an issue within our Pacstall packages that allowed for certain package files to be overwritten when a system upgrade would occur. We solved this by splitting the pacscript's `post_install` functions to make use of  `post_upgrade` as well so that certain files created by programs are not overwritten on an upgrade.

Deployed devices (Pine64 and Raspberry Pi) were not properly auto-resizing to fit the volume size in several previous releases.

## Pacstall changes

## As well as...
- Kernel version `6.12.12` ships by default on Generic ISO disk images.
- Kernel version `6.9.0-okpine` ships by default on Pine64 images.
- Kernel version `6.11.0-raspi` ships by default on Raspberry Pi images.
- An issue with the `hello-rhino` greeter application has been solved, to make it fit on XGA+ display resolutions.

Many thanks, and happy rolling,

The Rhino Linux Team.
