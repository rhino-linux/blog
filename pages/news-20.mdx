# KDE Plasma UBXI package released + more.

In 2023, we detailed our plans for the [Unicorn Beyond XFCE Initiative](https://blog.rhinolinux.org/news-9), with the simple goal of porting the Unicorn workflow, theming, and design to other desktop environments. These should then be packaged up in a pacscript for use on Rhino Linux. After 3 months of development and fine-tuning we are now happy to announce that the KDE Plasma UBXI Desktop package, bringing the experience of Unicorn straight to KDE Plasma.

To switch to the KDE Plasma desktop on Rhino Linux, please install it with `rpk install ubxi-kde-desktop-git`.

We plan to offer a disk image with KDE UBXI, meaning you can use Rhino Linux with Plasma right out of the box, by the end of 2025. However, since we are nearing our next release, this won't be possible within our current release window.

## rhino-pkg2 in stampede.

Our rewrite of rhino-pkg, rpk2, has now finally hit stampede (our testing grounds), meaning that it is nearing release. People can install and test it either by: `pacstall -PI rhino-stampede-dev`, which includes the unicons icon pack while it is in progress, or directly with `rhinu-pkg-git`.

The command can be invoked either as `rhinu-pkg` or as `rpk2`, until it is fully released and merged into rhino-pkg.

Many thanks,
The Rhino Linux Team.
