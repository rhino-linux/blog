A recent change in upstream Ubuntu's coreutils (via uutils) causes breakage to Pacstall, which prevents it from being able to run *any* commands. We have pushed an emergency patch to resolve this issue, but running `rpk update` may result in Pacstall being unable to update itself. To fix this, please run the following command to update it manually:
```bash
LC_ALL=C pacstall -U
```
We apologize for any caused inconvenience.
